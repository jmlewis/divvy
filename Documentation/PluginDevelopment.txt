Things to remember when developing a Divvy plugin

General comments
- The prefix header for the plugin needs to be set to Divvy_Prefix.pch (in the plugin's build settings)
- C source files need extension .c (not .cpp)
- When creating new classes and C source files, make sure they don't get added to the Divvy application target (uncheck that target in the creation dialog)

Required resources
- The main plugin class DivvyYourPluginName (e.g. DivvyPCA), it must conform to one and only one of the plugin protocols and derive from NSManagedObject
- The controller class for the UI DivvyYourPluginNameController, it derives from NSViewController
- The UI DivvyYourPluginName.xib
- The property list DivvyYourPluginName-Info.plist
- The data model DivvyYourPluginName.xcdatamodel
- These should all be assigned to a loadable bundle target in Xcode called DivvyYourPluginName, and compile to DivvyYourPluginName.plugin (not the .bundle default)

Data Model
- At least one entity called YourPluginName
- YourPluginName entity is assigned to the DivvyYourPluginName configuration (in wrench segment of rightmost panel of the data modeling tool in Xcode)
- YourPluginName entity is assigned the class DivvyYourPluginName

Property List
- "Main nib file base name" is DivvyYourPluginName
- "Principal class" is DivvyYourPluginName
- You will have to add these entries to the plist

UI
- "Raises For Not Applicable Keys" must not be checked in any bindings to parameters of your plugin
- The class identity (in the rightmost identity panel) of the File's Owner should be set to DivvyYourPluginNameController
- File's Owner's view outlet needs to be connected to the custom view in the .xib
